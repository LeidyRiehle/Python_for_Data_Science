# Python for Data Science

The plan is simple:

We choose a course which is completely free, create a schedule to make progress together and meet once per week to discuss course content. 

The course weâ€™ve chosen is "Getting started with Python" by University of Michigan:

This course is available on the Coursera platform and is free-to-audit. 
This means, we can access all the course material and assignments without paying for a certificate.
If you want to earn a certificate, you will have to upgrade your subscription.
